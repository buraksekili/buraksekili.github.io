For details, please have a look to official EKS docs mentioned on Resources section.\nEKS (Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service) It manages Kubernetes control-plane on behalf of you, ensures that each cluster has its own control plane. So, as an end-user, you only need to handle your workloads in worker nodes. All control plane related stuff will be handled by AWS.\nControl plane provisions at least two Kubernetes API Servers and three etcd instances across three AZs in the AWS.\nEKS will monitor your control-plane and if it fails or falls down, EKS handles this situations so that you will have control planes at high availability.\nNetworking The control plane is deployed in a VPC managed by AWS. So, this VPC is not visible to customers. And in order to deploy EKS cluster (workloads, nodes etc…), you need to deploy them into a VPC again which is different than the one managed by AWS.\nSo, this means that you have two VPCs - one is managed by AWS for control plane and the other is managed by customer for data plane (workloads).\nIn that case, you need to configure your VPC configuration carefully. Your VPC needs to connect AWS’s VPC where control plane is created in order to talk with API Server. Otherwise - if you VPC cannot communicate with AWS’s VPC -, your nodes cannot register Kubernetes control plane which prevents scheduler from scheduling pods to worker nodes.\nYour API Server’s endpoint can be public - which is default - or private. As a default option, EKS bootstraps an endpooint for API server. Optionally, you can enable private access to the Kubernetes API server. This means that the communication between the nodes and API server happens within the VPC.\nFor more details, please advise to EKS docs: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/network_reqs.html\nEKS both supports IPv4 and IPv6 but by default, it uses IPv4 and recommends having at least two subnets created in different AZs while creating the cluster.\ncluster subnets: subnets specified during cluster creation.\nVPC Your VPC must have sufficient number of IP addresses so that resources on the cluster can be assigned to an IP address. Your VPC must support DNS hostname and resolution support to allow nodes to register to the cluster. Subnet Two subnets in different AZs - in at least two AZs. Subnets must have at least six IP addresses - ideally at least 16 IP addresses for EKS. Subnets can be public or private but the recommend way is private subnets. If you need an ingress from internet to your Pods, make sure that you have at least 1 public subnet to deploy loadbalancers. In this case, loadbalancers can be deployed into public or private subnets based on your use case but the nodes should be deployed in private subnets if possible. If you want to deploy LB into a subnet, subnet needs specific tags. If the LB needs to be private, add kubernetes.io/role/internal-elb: 1, otherwise kubernetes.io/role/elb: 1. Service of LoadBalancer type To load balance the network traffic at L4, deploy kubernetes Service with type of LoadBalancer. In AWS, EKS provisions ALB (AWS Application Load Balancer) for you.\nMake sure that your VPC and Subnet requirements are met. ALB chooses one subnet from each AZ. If you tag kubernetes.io/cluster/my-cluster=shared public subnet(s), it enables creating Service of LoadBalancer\nSecurity Groups SGs are used to control communication between the control plane and worker nodes. When you provision a cluster, EKS creates a default SG and associates this SG to all nodes. The default rules allow all traffic communication between nodes and all outbound traffic to any destination.\nNode communication The recommended way is having a both private and public subnets with minimum of two public subnets and two private subnets where private subnets are in two AZs.\nYou can provision load balancers in public subnets which forwards traffic to the workloads (Pods) created on private subnets.\nCluster endpoint As mentioned above, EKS provisions the cluster with public-only cluster endpoint. The recommended way is to have public-private mode where Kubernetes API calls within your cluster (from control plane to worker nodes or vice versa) uses private VPC.\nCNI When you provision EKS cluster, Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) CNI is enabled by default\nLoad Balancing Choose ALB if your workloads runs HTTP/HTTPS. If your workloads run TCP, use NLB.\nFor EKS, there are two targets for the target group of your load balancer; instance and ip.\nTarget group forwards requests to the registered targets such as EC2 instance as per docs\nInstance target This target will be the node IP of the worker node.\nSo, the incoming traffic will be routed to worker node through NodePort, and then the Service of ClusterIP selects a pod to forward the traffic.\nThis process has extra network hops and also sometimes ClusterIP service might select a Pod which runs on different node (different AZ) which will increase the latency.\nIP target Now, the traffic will be directly forwarded to the Pods. So, it significantly reduces the latency as the process does not include hops between NodePort and Service.\nResources https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/what-is-eks.html https://aws.github.io/aws-eks-best-practices/ ","wordCount":"872","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2024-08-13T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2024-08-13T13:32:53+03:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Burak Sekili"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://buraksekili.github.io/articles/eks/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Burak Sekili","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://buraksekili.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://buraksekili.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Burak Sekili (Alt + H)">Burak Sekili</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)">
