[{"content":"Working with Custom Data Format in Rust using serde If you need to perform serialization or deserialization in Rust, you’ve most likely used the serde before. I’m currently learning Rust, and I found myself needing similar thing.\nTo get familiar with the Rust ecosystem, I decided to develop a simple key-value store. Initially, the engine for this key-value store was designed to work with JSON objects, as JSON is a widely-used format that’s straightforward to use with web clients. Also, as most of the languages and platforms already support JSON, it is a good choice to start with.\nWhat I wanted to achieve was that users send JSON objects to indicate their request, such as \u0026ldquo;give me the value of key \u0026rdquo;, which can be represented as { \u0026quot;key\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;some_key\u0026quot; } in JSON. The response is also formatted as a JSON object, like {\u0026quot;value\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;value_of_the_key\u0026quot;}. The concept and requirements of this server are quite simple and clear.\nI generally use Go for my projects, where the JSON serialization/deserialization process is straightforward. You can manage it with some tags on your struct, and the rest is handled by Go itself. In Rust, achieving the same thing is also straightforward with serde. You only need to add a few macros, and serde will automatically implement serialization and deserialization methods for you. As JSON is one of the most popular data formats, you can set this up with just a few lines of code. I am not going to give details about how to achieve this as serde documentation has handful examples regarding this.\nAfter checking similar projects, I realized that most of the engines do not use these widely adopted data formats in place with their storage engine. Of course, the reasons of this may vary but the fundamental concerns are more or less the same: performance and simplicity. In my case, users only get, set or rm the key. So, using JSON is a bit overkill here. I totally agree that it is quite straightforward to implement and get start with JSON but what happens if I want to introduce a simple - and to be honest useless and dumbest - data format to interact with my key-value storage engine? Considering that my learning purpose of Rust, the idea looks okay to me.\nThen, I started to focus on how to work with custom data format with serde? So that I can serialize Rust data types to my data format and deserialize some byte sequence such as strings back to Rust types?\nConcepts Before jumping into implementation details, it\u0026rsquo;d be better to get familiar with some core concepts that we are going to be using.\nData Format First things first, let’s try to understand what the data format is. Simply put, a data format defines how the data is stored and structured. For example, well-known data formats such as JSON, CSV, and TOML can store the same data but in different ways.\nYou probably use these formats on a daily basis as they are widely adopted and used. Almost every language support these data formats more or less. Although these formats use different syntax while representing the data, the underlying data they represent is the same.\nIn my case, I wanted to introduce a simple custom data format, which looks like this:\n+:\u0026lt;cmd_name\u0026gt; \u0026lt;key\u0026gt; \u0026lt;optional_value\u0026gt;: This format allows me to store a sequence of commands - essentially the requests that users send to the key-value engine, such as fetching a key - in a log file. This format is of course not complicated and maybe even not quite helpful compared to JSON but it is of course cleaner and easier for me to work with. For instance, using this format makes it easy for my parser to determine where a command request starts in the file, as each command is prefixed with +: and ends with a colon :.\nThis data format of course is NOT a JSON (or YAML, CSV and whatever) which means I cannot use existing deserializer of already knowns data formats. This means I need to implement my own basic serializer and deserializer to convert Rust data structures, such as enum or struct, into this custom format and vice versa.\nFor simple use cases like mine, you do not even need to write a full Serializer and Deserializer using serde. You can implement a custom deserialize method and a visitor to handle most tasks. My primary goal in creating these custom serializers and deserializers is to learn and understand the process better.\nData Type The data types refer to the way data is stored in memory and classified in the language that we use. In Rust and in many other languages, data types can be simple types such as integers, floating number, booleans and composite ones like structs, enums, and classes.\nOn the other hand, data format is how this data type is stored and structured in the storage.\nFor example, the following Get struct in Rust corresponds to the data type:\n1 2 3 struct Get { key: String, } where, storing this data type as a JSON string as {\u0026quot;key\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;some_key\u0026quot;} is the data format.\nSerialization and Deserialization With that being said, serialization is the process of converting or transforming these data types into a specific data format. For example, if you use a JSON serializer, it will convert your Rust data types into a JSON compatible string representation.\nThe deserialization is kind of the reverse process of the serialization where it takes your input (like as a string, byte sequence or in binary) and converts this input back into the data types, which might be struct or vector etc.\nSerialization As clearly mentioned in serde documentation, serde is NOT a parsing library. So, i am not going to dive into how to parse the stream.\nIn our case, the request that users send is represented as enum type, as follows:\n1 2 3 4 5 pub enum Request { Get { key: String }, Set { key: String, val: String }, Rm { key: String }, } First start with serializing this data type into our custom data format:\n+:\u0026lt;cmd_name\u0026gt; \u0026lt;key\u0026gt; \u0026lt;optional_value\u0026gt;: In order to serialize our enum, we need to implement Serialize trait for our Request type. This trait only has one required method called serialize. For most of the time, you do not need to implement the trait from scratch. There is a helper procedural macro called serde_derive to implement the trait for you. So, let\u0026rsquo;s add this macro to our type.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 use serde::Serialize; #[derive(Serialize)] pub enum Request { Get { key: String }, Set { key: String, val: String }, Rm { key: String }, } Eventually, this macro generates the following code (which shows the generated code in simplified manner) for Request struct.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 // for more, please check https://docs.rs/serde/1.0.208/serde/ser/trait.Serialize.html impl Serialize for Request { fn serialize\u0026lt;S\u0026gt;(\u0026amp;self, serializer: S) -\u0026gt; Result\u0026lt;S::Ok, S::Error\u0026gt; where S: Serializer, { match *self { Request::Get { ref key } =\u0026gt; { let mut s = serializer.serialize_struct_variant(\u0026#34;Request\u0026#34;, 0, \u0026#34;Get\u0026#34;, 1)?; s.serialize_field(\u0026#34;key\u0026#34;, key)?; s.end() } Request::Set { ref key, ref val } =\u0026gt; { let mut s = serializer.serialize_struct_variant(\u0026#34;Request\u0026#34;, 1, \u0026#34;Set\u0026#34;, 2)?; s.serialize_field(\u0026#34;key\u0026#34;, key)?; s.serialize_field(\u0026#34;val\u0026#34;, val)?; s.end() } Request::Rm { ref key } =\u0026gt; { let mut s = s.serialize_struct_variant(\u0026#34;Request\u0026#34;, 2, \u0026#34;Rm\u0026#34;, 1)?; s.serialize_field(\u0026#34;key\u0026#34;, key)?; s.end(s) } } } } Instead of manually running serialize_field on each field of our enum, the macro will automatically generate the necessary code for us. This makes it easier to use in most cases.\nTo understand the flow, let’s break down what the serialize method does. It knows how to instruct Serializer to serialize the Request struct. Then, for each field in the enum, it calls serialize_field by using Serializer that is passed to serialize method.\nIf you want to use an existing serializer, like a JSON serializer, you can pass that serializer into the serialize method. The serializer will then handle the serialization process for you, converting your Rust data types into a JSON compatible format.\nHowever, in our case, we want to serialize the Request data type into our custom data format, which is not compatible with JSON or any other standard data formats. This means we need to implement our own custom serialization logic to handle this specific format - at least as scope of this blog post :).\nTo write our own Serializer, we need to implement serde::ser::Serializer trait. If you check the trait, it includes lots of required methods. But of course, not all of these methods need to be implemented in every case. Most of the methods are related to serializing specific types, like structs or i32.\nIn our case, we need to serialize a struct type. Based on the code generated by Serialize macro, we call serialize_struct_variant method. Therefore, we\u0026rsquo;ll definitely need to implement this method.\nAlso, we need to specify some required associated types of Serializer trait: Ok, Error and SerializeStructVariant in the Serializer trait.\ntype Ok corresponds to the output type that we generate after serialization. In our case, we can use () for Ok value since we are going to store the the serialization result in-memory and then write it to io::Write.\ntype Error corresponds to the error type that we may face during serialization. For the error type, we can define a custom Error type by following conventions here.\ntype SerializeStructVariant corresponds to the type returned from the serialize_struct_variant method. We can set SerializeStructVariant to Self, meaning our Serializer will be returned as the result of the serialize_struct_variant method. This allows us to use the serialization methods that we define within our custom Serializer.\nHere’s a simplified version of what our Serializer implementation will look like (omitting other methods that we don\u0026rsquo;t need to implement):\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 impl\u0026lt;\u0026#39;a\u0026gt; ser::Serializer for \u0026amp;\u0026#39;a mut KvRequestSerializer { type Ok = (); type Error = Error; type SerializeStructVariant = Self; fn serialize_struct_variant( self, _name: \u0026amp;\u0026#39;static str, _variant_index: u32, variant: \u0026amp;\u0026#39;static str, _len: usize, ) -\u0026gt; std::result::Result\u0026lt;Self::SerializeStructVariant, Self::Error\u0026gt; { let req_type = match variant { \u0026#34;Set\u0026#34; =\u0026gt; Ok(\u0026#34;set\u0026#34;), \u0026#34;Get\u0026#34; =\u0026gt; Ok(\u0026#34;get\u0026#34;), \u0026#34;Rm\u0026#34; =\u0026gt; Ok(\u0026#34;rm\u0026#34;), _ =\u0026gt; Err(Error::InvalidData(String::from(\u0026#34;invalid request provided\u0026#34;))), }?; self.output += \u0026#34;+:\u0026#34;; self.output += req_type; Ok(self) } // and other required methods and types... } impl\u0026lt;\u0026#39;a\u0026gt; ser::SerializeStructVariant for \u0026amp;\u0026#39;a mut KvRequestSerializer { type Ok = (); type Error = Error; fn serialize_field\u0026lt;T\u0026gt;( \u0026amp;mut self, _key: \u0026amp;\u0026#39;static str, value: \u0026amp;T, ) -\u0026gt; std::result::Result\u0026lt;(), Self::Error\u0026gt; where T: ?Sized + Serialize, { value.serialize(\u0026amp;mut **self)?; Ok(()) } fn end(self) -\u0026gt; std::result::Result\u0026lt;Self::Ok, Self::Error\u0026gt; { self.output += \u0026#34;:\u0026#34;; Ok(()) } } So, for example in order to serialize Request::Get {key: \u0026quot;abc\u0026quot;}, based on the serialize method (which is generated by Serialize macro)\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 // serialize_struct_variant returns Result\u0026lt;Self::SerializeStructVariant, Self::Error\u0026gt; // which means succesfull results yield Self::SerializeStructVariant. // In our case, we defined `type SerializeStructVariant` as Self again. // So, the result of `serialize_struct_variant` method will be `KvRequestSerializer`. // // In the following code, `s` is type of KvRequestSerializer // which implements SerializeStructVariant trait. So that we can serialize the structs. let mut s = serializer.serialize_struct_variant(\u0026#34;Request\u0026#34;, 0, \u0026#34;Get\u0026#34;, 1)?; // now, s points to KvRequestSerializer and we already implement SerializeStructVariant trait. s.serialize_field(\u0026#34;key\u0026#34;, key)?; s.end() This flow will be resulted through following process:\nKvRequestSerializer\u0026rsquo;s serialize_struct_variant method. Here, we have information about how our Rust data type look like. KvRequestSerializer\u0026rsquo;s serialize_field method in SerializeStructVariant trait implementation. Here, we know each key of the Request::Get enum and its values KvRequestSerializer\u0026rsquo;s serialize_str. Then we pass the value of key field to serialize_str. So that we can form our desired data format Lastly we call end method from SerializeStructVariant During the process, we store the result of each operation in the output field of our Serializer. At the end, we can pass this output to our desired output location.\nNow, we implemented our serializer. Let\u0026rsquo;s write a simple test to verify the result. Before jumping into test cases, let\u0026rsquo;s define a function that eases usage of our serializer.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 pub fn serialize\u0026lt;T: ser::Serialize\u0026gt;(request: \u0026amp;T) -\u0026gt; String { let mut serializer = KvRequestSerializer { output: String::new(), }; request.serialize(\u0026amp;mut serializer).expect(\u0026#34;failed to serialize\u0026#34;); serializer.output } #[test] fn test_serialization_request_struct() { use crate::request::Request; let get_request = Request::Get { key: \u0026#34;get_key_testing\u0026#34;.to_owned(), }; let expected_get = \u0026#34;+:get get_key_testing:\u0026#34;; assert_eq!(serialize(\u0026amp;get_request), expected_get); } Now that our serializer works as expected, let\u0026rsquo;s move on to deserializing our custom data format into the Request type by implementing our own deserializer.\nDeserialization Writing a custom deserializer can be more complicated than writing a serializer. I found myself confused quite often while working on the implementation at first. However, I\u0026rsquo;ll try to simplify the explanation as much as possible.\nIn serde, deserialization is a two-phase process that involves both a Deserializer and a Visitor. Let\u0026rsquo;s start with the Deserializer.\nDeserializer is responsible for interpreting the input, which is a data format in form of string, byte, binary etc., and matching this input data format to serde data model, such as integer, sequence and so on. Here, the serde data model refers to the data types defined within serde, which correspond closely to Rust\u0026rsquo;s type system. For example, bool in serde corresponds to the boolean type in Rust. The serde documentation provides a clear explanation of the data model, including an example using OsString, which is highly recommended if you\u0026rsquo;re not already familiar with serde\u0026rsquo;s data model. Please refer to the docs https://serde.rs/data-model.html.\nOnce the Deserializer matches input data to the appropriate serde data model, a Visitor is then used to analyze this generic data and convert it into the specific data type we want to achieve.\nAlthough this process may sound complicated, let\u0026rsquo;s break it down using a concrete example based on our case. Suppose we have a string like get abc:. Our deserialize method will call deserialize_str on our custom deserializer. This flow is similar to how the Serializer calls serialize_struct_variant, knowing that the data type is a struct. In our case, we know that our data format is a string that contains a single request. Thus, we will call deserialize_str. As opposed to serialize method, now we do not need to use macro to autogenerate deserialize method for Request type. As we already know that the input data format will be a string, we will implement deserialize method in a way that it will call deserialize_str method of our custom deserializer.\nWhen the deserializer\u0026rsquo;s deserialize_str method is called, it will, in turn, call the visit_str method on a visitor that we provide. This means we need to implement our own Visitor to handle string representation of our custom data format. Finally, within the visit_str method of our Visitor, we will parse the string and create the corresponding Request enum type based on the input.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s try to implement this deserialization process. As we did with the Serializer, we\u0026rsquo;ll start with the deserialize method for our data type - Request enum - which will instruct our custom deserializer.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 impl\u0026lt;\u0026#39;de\u0026gt; de::Deserialize\u0026lt;\u0026#39;de\u0026gt; for Request { fn deserialize\u0026lt;D\u0026gt;(deserializer: D) -\u0026gt; Result\u0026lt;Self, D::Error\u0026gt; where D: de::Deserializer\u0026lt;\u0026#39;de\u0026gt;, { deserializer.deserialize_str(RequestVisitor) } } If we look at the deserialize method, you\u0026rsquo;ll notice that we pass our deserializer to this method (similar to how we did it with the serialize method). Since we know our custom data format is a string, we\u0026rsquo;ll directly call deserialize_str. This is actually suitable for our simple data format. However, we also need to pass a RequestVisitor as an argument to deserialize_str. This requires us to create a visitor that implements the de::Visitor trait. The RequestVisitor will process the string input and try to generate the appropriate Request enum.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 pub struct RequestVisitor; impl\u0026lt;\u0026#39;de\u0026gt; de::Visitor\u0026lt;\u0026#39;de\u0026gt; for RequestVisitor { type Value = Request; fn expecting(\u0026amp;self, formatter: \u0026amp;mut std::fmt::Formatter) -\u0026gt; std::fmt::Result { formatter.write_str(\u0026#34;a command in the format \u0026#39;:\u0026lt;cmd\u0026gt; \u0026lt;required_key\u0026gt; \u0026lt;optional_value\u0026gt;\u0026#39;\u0026#34;) } fn visit_str\u0026lt;E\u0026gt;(self, cmd_str: \u0026amp;str) -\u0026gt; std::result::Result\u0026lt;Self::Value, E\u0026gt; where E: de::Error, { let inputs = cmd_str.split_whitespace().collect::\u0026lt;Vec\u0026lt;\u0026amp;str\u0026gt;\u0026gt;(); let len = inputs.len(); if len != 2 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; len != 3 { return Err(de::Error::custom( \u0026#34;invalid command request provided, valid commands are \u0026#39;get\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;set\u0026#39; and \u0026#39;rm\u0026#39;\u0026#34;, )); } let cmd_name = inputs[0]; let get_key = |key: \u0026amp;str| -\u0026gt; String { let trimmed = key.trim(); if trimmed.ends_with(\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;) { return trimmed .get(0..trimmed.len() - 1) .unwrap_or(trimmed) .to_owned(); } return trimmed.to_owned(); }; let key = inputs[1]; match cmd_name { \u0026#34;get\u0026#34; =\u0026gt; Ok(Request::Get { key: get_key(key) }), \u0026#34;rm\u0026#34; =\u0026gt; Ok(Request::Rm { key: get_key(key) }), \u0026#34;set\u0026#34; =\u0026gt; { let val = inputs[2].trim(); Ok(Request::Set { key: key.to_owned(), val: get_key(val), }) } _ =\u0026gt; Err(de::Error::custom( \u0026#34;invalid command is provided, valid commands are \u0026#39;get\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;set\u0026#39; and \u0026#39;rm\u0026#39;\u0026#34;, )), } } } The Visitor trait has only one required method: expecting which will be used in error messages. While other methods like visit_str have default implementations, we need to override and implement the methods necessary for our use case. In this case, since we are working with string values, we\u0026rsquo;ll implement visit_str, which will handle parsing the given string.\nFor our example, visit_str will expect strings like get abc:, set key value:, or rm key:. The visit_str method will attempt to convert these strings into the corresponding Request enum variants.\nFinally we can implement our deserializer which will simply call the visitor\u0026rsquo;s visit_str method, as follows:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 pub struct Deserializer\u0026lt;\u0026#39;de\u0026gt; { input: \u0026amp;\u0026#39;de str, } impl\u0026lt;\u0026#39;de, \u0026#39;a\u0026gt; de::Deserializer\u0026lt;\u0026#39;de\u0026gt; for \u0026amp;\u0026#39;a mut Deserializer\u0026lt;\u0026#39;de\u0026gt; { type Error = Error; fn deserialize_str\u0026lt;V\u0026gt;(self, visitor: V) -\u0026gt; std::result::Result\u0026lt;V::Value, Self::Error\u0026gt; where V: de::Visitor\u0026lt;\u0026#39;de\u0026gt;, { visitor.visit_str::\u0026lt;Self::Error\u0026gt;(\u0026amp;self.input) } // Rest of the deserialize_* methods ... // // As Serializer, i do not list them all here as there is a deserialize_* // method for almost all type. // // For more detail about it, please refer to the: // https://docs.rs/serde/1.0.208/serde/trait.Deserializer.html# } This approach keeps the deserialization process straightforward and clean. Now, let\u0026rsquo;s write a simple test scenario to verify our implementation.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 fn deserialize\u0026lt;\u0026#39;a, T: de::Deserialize\u0026lt;\u0026#39;a\u0026gt;\u0026gt;(input: \u0026amp;\u0026#39;a str) -\u0026gt; Result\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; { let mut deserializer = Deserializer::from_str(input); let t = T::deserialize(\u0026amp;mut deserializer)?; Ok(t) } #[test] fn test_deserialize_set() { let data = r\u0026#34;set burak 123:\u0026#34;; let expected = Request::Set { key: \u0026#34;burak\u0026#34;.to_string(), val: \u0026#34;123\u0026#34;.to_string(), }; let result: Request = deserialize(data).expect(\u0026#34;failed to deserialize\u0026#34;); } I hope this post helps you get started with your own serde implementations.

For details, please have a look to official EKS docs mentioned on Resources section.\nEKS (Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service) It manages Kubernetes control-plane on behalf of you, ensures that each cluster has its own control plane. So, as an end-user, you only need to handle your workloads in worker nodes. All control plane related stuff will be handled by AWS.\nControl plane provisions at least two Kubernetes API Servers and three etcd instances across three AZs in the AWS.\nEKS will monitor your control-plane and if it fails or falls down, EKS handles this situations so that you will have control planes at high availability.\nNetworking The control plane is deployed in a VPC managed by AWS. So, this VPC is not visible to customers. And in order to deploy EKS cluster (workloads, nodes etc\u0026hellip;), you need to deploy them into a VPC again which is different than the one managed by AWS.\nSo, this means that you have two VPCs - one is managed by AWS for control plane and the other is managed by customer for data plane (workloads).\nIn that case, you need to configure your VPC configuration carefully. Your VPC needs to connect AWS\u0026rsquo;s VPC where control plane is created in order to talk with API Server. Otherwise - if you VPC cannot communicate with AWS\u0026rsquo;s VPC -, your nodes cannot register Kubernetes control plane which prevents scheduler from scheduling pods to worker nodes.\nYour API Server\u0026rsquo;s endpoint can be public - which is default - or private. As a default option, EKS bootstraps an endpooint for API server. Optionally, you can enable private access to the Kubernetes API server. This means that the communication between the nodes and API server happens within the VPC.\nFor more details, please advise to EKS docs: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/network_reqs.html\nEKS both supports IPv4 and IPv6 but by default, it uses IPv4 and recommends having at least two subnets created in different AZs while creating the cluster.\ncluster subnets: subnets specified during cluster creation.\nVPC Your VPC must have sufficient number of IP addresses so that resources on the cluster can be assigned to an IP address. Your VPC must support DNS hostname and resolution support to allow nodes to register to the cluster. Subnet Two subnets in different AZs - in at least two AZs. Subnets must have at least six IP addresses - ideally at least 16 IP addresses for EKS. Subnets can be public or private but the recommend way is private subnets. If you need an ingress from internet to your Pods, make sure that you have at least 1 public subnet to deploy loadbalancers. In this case, loadbalancers can be deployed into public or private subnets based on your use case but the nodes should be deployed in private subnets if possible. If you want to deploy LB into a subnet, subnet needs specific tags. If the LB needs to be private, add kubernetes.io/role/internal-elb: 1, otherwise kubernetes.io/role/elb: 1. Service of LoadBalancer type To load balance the network traffic at L4, deploy kubernetes Service with type of LoadBalancer. In AWS, EKS provisions ALB (AWS Application Load Balancer) for you.\nMake sure that your VPC and Subnet requirements are met. ALB chooses one subnet from each AZ. If you tag kubernetes.io/cluster/my-cluster=shared public subnet(s), it enables creating Service of LoadBalancer\nSecurity Groups SGs are used to control communication between the control plane and worker nodes. When you provision a cluster, EKS creates a default SG and associates this SG to all nodes. The default rules allow all traffic communication between nodes and all outbound traffic to any destination.\nNode communication The recommended way is having a both private and public subnets with minimum of two public subnets and two private subnets where private subnets are in two AZs.\nYou can provision load balancers in public subnets which forwards traffic to the workloads (Pods) created on private subnets.\nCluster endpoint As mentioned above, EKS provisions the cluster with public-only cluster endpoint. The recommended way is to have public-private mode where Kubernetes API calls within your cluster (from control plane to worker nodes or vice versa) uses private VPC.\nCNI When you provision EKS cluster, Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) CNI is enabled by default\nLoad Balancing Choose ALB if your workloads runs HTTP/HTTPS. If your workloads run TCP, use NLB.\nFor EKS, there are two targets for the target group of your load balancer; instance and ip.\nTarget group forwards requests to the registered targets such as EC2 instance as per docs\nInstance target This target will be the node IP of the worker node.\nSo, the incoming traffic will be routed to worker node through NodePort, and then the Service of ClusterIP selects a pod to forward the traffic.\nThis process has extra network hops and also sometimes ClusterIP service might select a Pod which runs on different node (different AZ) which will increase the latency.\nIP target Now, the traffic will be directly forwarded to the Pods. So, it significantly reduces the latency as the process does not include hops between NodePort and Service.\nResources https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/what-is-eks.html https://aws.github.io/aws-eks-best-practices/ ","permalink":"https://buraksekili.github.io/articles/eks/","summary":"This guide is a summary of AWS EKS Best practices documentation to help me to skim through some concepts that i usually refer to.

Hence, the program fails as all goroutines are asleep - deadlock!\nSo, if we have another goroutine that helps main goroutine by receiving a data from the channel, the program won\u0026rsquo;t be paniced.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 package main import \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; func main() { ch := make(chan struct{}) go func() { \u0026lt;-ch }() ch \u0026lt;- struct{}{} fmt.Println(\u0026#34;Done\u0026#34;) } Output:\n1 2 $ go run main.go Done First listen channel in another goroutine, then write data to it.

Users tend to prefer it over client-go.\nThe increased adoption of projects like Kubebuilder or Operator SDK has facilitated the creation of Kubernetes Operator projects. Users need to implement minimal requirements to start with Kubernetes controllers, thanks to these projects.\nAs a developer working on Kubernetes projects, I inevitably touch code pieces utilizing controller-runtime Whenever I dive into code base, I always learn something new about the underlying mechanism of Kubernetes.\nThrough this blog series, I aim to share my learning regarding controller-runtime consolidating my notes spread across various notebooks.\nThis article will specifically dive into the role of controller-runtime Manager.\nWhat are Controllers and Operators? controller-runtime has emerged as the go-to package for building Kubernetes controllers. However, it is essential to understand what these controllers - or Kubernetes Operators - are.\nIn Kubernetes, controllers observe resources, such as Deployments, in a control loop to ensure the cluster resources conform to the desired state specified in the resource specification (e.g., YAML files) 1.\nOn the other hand, according to Redhat, a Kubernetes Operator is an application-specific controller 2. For instance, the Prometheus Operator manages the lifecycle of a Prometheus instance in the cluster, including managing configurations and updating Kubernetes resources, such as ConfigMaps.\nRoughly both are quite similar. They provide a control loop to ensure the current state meets the desired state.\nThe Architecture of Controllers Since controllers are in charge of meeting the desired state of the resources in Kubernetes, they somehow need to be informed about the changes on the resources and perform certain operations if needed. For this, controllers follow a special architecture to\nobserve the resources, inform any events (updating, deleting, adding) done on the resources, keep a local cache to decrease the load on API Server, keep a work queue to pick up events, run workers to perform reconciliation on resources picked up from work queue. This architecture is clearly pictured in client-go documentation:\nreference: client-go documentation Most end-users typically do not need to interact with the sections outlined in blue in the architecture. The controller-runtime effectively manages these elements. The subsequent section will explain these components in simple terms.\nTo simply put, controllers use\ncache to prevent sending each getter request to API server, workqueue which includes the key of the object that needs to be reconciled, workers to process items reconciliation. Informer Informers watch Kubernetes API server to detect changes in resources that we want to. It keeps a local cache - in-memory cache implementing Store interface - including the objects observed through Kubernetes API. Then controllers and operators use this cache for all getter requests - GET and LIST - to prevent load on Kubernetes API server. Moreover, Informers invoke controllers by sending objects to the controllers (registering Event Handlers).\nInformers leverage certain components like Reflector, Queue and Indexer, as shown in the above diagram.\nReflector According to godocs:\nReflector watches a specified resource and causes all changes to be reflected in the given store.\nThe store is actually a cache - with two options; simple one and FIFO. Reflector pushes objects to Delta Fifo queue.\nBy monitoring the server (Kubernetes API Server), the Reflector maintains a local cache of the resources. Upon any event occurring on the watched resource, implying a new operation on the Kubernetes resource, the Reflector updates the cache (Delta FIFO queue, as illustrated in the diagram). Subsequently, the Informer reads objects from this Delta FIFO queue, indexes them for future retrievals, and dispatches the object to the controller.\nIndexer Indexer saves objects into thread-safe Store by indexing the objects. This approach facilitates efficient querying of objects from the cache.\nCustom indexers, based on specific needs, can be created. For example, a custom indexer can be generated to retrieve all objects based on certain fields, such as Annotations.\nManager According to godocs\nmanager is required to create controllers and provides shared dependencies such as clients, caches, schemes, etc. Controllers must be started by calling Manager.Start.\nThe Manager serves as a crucial component for controllers by managing their operations. To put it simply, the manager oversees one or more controllers that watch the resources (e.g., Pods) of interest.\nEach operator requires a Manager to operate, as the Manager controls the controllers, webhooks, metric servers, logs, leader elections, caches, and other components.\nFor all dependencies managed by the Manager, please refer to the Manager interface\nController Dependencies As godocs mentioned, Manager provides shared dependencies such as clients, caches, schemes etc. These dependencies are shared among the controllers managed by the Manager. If you have registered two controllers with the Manager, these controllers will share common resources.\nReconciliation, or the reconcile loop, involves the operators or controllers executing the business logic for the watched resources. For example, a Deployment controller might create a specific number of Pods as specified in the Deployment spec.\nThe Client package exposes functionalities to communicate with the Kubernetes API 3. Controllers, registered with a specific Manager, utilize the same client to interact with the Kubernetes API. The main operations of the client include reading and writing.\nReading operations mostly utilize the cache to access the Kubernetes API, rather than accessing it directly, to reduce the load on the Kubernetes API. In contrast, write operations directly communicate with the Kubernetes API. However, this behavior can be modified so that read requests are directed to the Kubernetes API. Nevertheless, this is generally not recommended unless there is a compelling reason to do so.\nThe cache is also shared across controllers, ensuring optimal performance. Consider a scenario where there are n controllers observing multiple resources in a cluster. If a separate cache is maintained for each controller, n caches will attempt to synchronize with the API Server, increasing the load on API Server. Instead, controller-runtime utilizes a shared cache called NewSharedIndexInformer for all controllers registered within a manager.\nIn the diagram above, two controllers maintain separate caches where both send ListAndWatch requests to API Server. However, controller-runtime utilizes a shared cache, reducing the need for multiple ListAndWatch operations.\nreference: controller-runtime/pkg/cache/internal/informers.go Code Whether you use Kubebuilder, Operator SDK, or controller-runtime directly, operators necessitate a Manager to function. The NewManager from controller-runtime facilitates the creation of a new manager.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 var ( // Refer to godocs for details // .... // NewManager returns a new Manager for creating Controllers. NewManager = manager.New\t) Under the hood, NewManager calls New from the manager package.\n1 func New(config *rest.Config, options Options) (Manager, error) For a simple setup, we can create a new manager as follows\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 import ( \u0026#34;log\u0026#34; ctrl \u0026#34;sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime\u0026#34; \u0026#34;sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/manager\u0026#34; ) func main() { mgr, err := ctrl.NewManager(ctrl.GetConfigOrDie(), manager.Options{}) if err != nil { log.Fatal(err) } } Though this code piece is sufficient to create a Manager, the crucial part involves configuring the Manager using manager.Options{}.\nManager Options manager.Options{} configures various dependencies, such as webhooks, clients, or leader elections under the hood.\nScheme As mentioned in the godocs:\nScheme is the scheme used to resolve runtime.Objects to GroupVersionKinds / Resources.\nSo, scheme helps us to register your objects Go type into GVK. If you are building operators, you will realize following code block in your operator:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 package main import ( \u0026#34;k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/runtime\u0026#34; runtimeschema \u0026#34;k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/runtime/schema\u0026#34; utilruntime \u0026#34;k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/util/runtime\u0026#34; \u0026#34;sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/scheme\u0026#34; ) var ( myscheme = runtime.NewScheme() // SchemeBuilder is used to add go types to the GroupVersionKind scheme SchemeBuilder = \u0026amp;scheme.Builder{ GroupVersion: runtimeschema.GroupVersion{ Group: \u0026#34;your.group\u0026#34;, Version: \u0026#34;v1alpha1\u0026#34;, }, } ) func init() { // Adds your GVK to the scheme that you provided, which is myscheme in our case. utilruntime.Must(SchemeBuilder.AddToScheme(myscheme)) } The scheme is responsible for registering the Go type declaration of your Kubernetes object into a GVK. This is significant as RESTMapper then translates GVK to GVR, establishing a distinct HTTP path for your Kubernetes resource. Consequently, this empowers the Kubernetes client to know the relevant endpoint for your resource.\nCache I mentioned cache a lot, but it is one of the most crucial piece of operators and controllers, where you can see its effect directly. As mentioned Controller Dependencies section, controller-runtime initializes NewSharedIndexInformer for our controllers under the hood. In order to configure cache, cache.Options{} needs to be utilized. There are again a couple of possible configurations possible but be careful while configuring your cache since it has an impact on performance and resource consumption of your operator.\nI specifically want to emphasize SyncPeriod and DefaultNamespaces\nSyncPeriod triggers reconciliation again for every object in the cache once the duration passes. By default, this is configured as 10 hours or so with some jitter across all controllers. Since running a reconciliation over all objects is quite expensive, be careful while adjusting this configuration.\nDefaultNamespaces configures caching objects in specified namespaces. For instance, to watch objects in prod namespace:\n1 2 3 4 5 manager.Options{ Cache: cache.Options{ DefaultNamespaces: map[string]cache.Config{\u0026#34;prod\u0026#34;: cache.Config{}}, }, } Controller The Controller field, in manager.Options{}, configures essential options for controllers registered to this Manager. These options are set using controller.Options{}.\nNotably, the MaxConcurrentReconciles attribute within this configuration governs the number of concurrent reconciles allowed. As detailed in the Architecture of Controllers section, controllers run workers to execute reconciliation tasks. These workers operate as goroutines. By default, a controller uses only one goroutine, but this can be adjusted using the MaxConcurrentReconciles attribute.\nAfter configuring the Manager\u0026rsquo;s options, the NewManager function generates the controllerManager structure, which implements the Runnable interface.\nDuring the creation of the controllerManager structure, controller-runtime initializes the Cluster to handle all necessary operations to interact with your cluster, including managing clients and caches.\nAll the settings provided within manager.Options{} are transferred to cluster.New() to create the cluster. This process calls the private function newCache(restConfig *rest.Config, opts Options) newCacheFunc, initiating the NewInformer, which uses the type SharedIndexInformer as referenced in the Controller Dependencies section.\nThe next step involves registering controllers to the Manager.\n1 2 3 ctrl.NewControllerManagedBy(mgr). // \u0026#39;mgr\u0026#39; refers to the controller-runtime Manager we\u0026#39;ve set up For(\u0026amp;your.Object{}). // The \u0026#39;For()\u0026#39; function takes the object your controller will reconcile Complete(r) // \u0026#39;Complete\u0026#39; builds the controller and starts watching. I will dive into the detailed explanation of the controller registration process in my future writings to avoid making this post excessively long.\nStarting Manager 1 2 3 4 5 // mgr corresponds to manager.Manager{} if err := mgr.Start(ctrl.SetupSignalHandler()); err != nil { setupLog.Error(err, \u0026#34;problem running manager\u0026#34;) os.Exit(1) } Once the manager starts, all required runnables in the manager will start, in the order of\ninternal HTTP servers; health probes, metrics and profiling if enabled. webhooks, cache, controllers, leader election. For reference, check Start(context.Context) method of controllerManager struct.\nFeel free to suggest improvements on GitHub or through my Twitter\nReferences https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://www.redhat.com/en/topics/containers/what-is-a-kubernetes-operator\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://pkg.go.dev/sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/client\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"https://buraksekili.github.io/articles/controller-runtime-1/","summary":"Introduction controller-runtime package has become a fundamental tool for most Kubernetes controllers, simplifying the creation of controllers to manage resources within a Kubernetes environment efficiently.
